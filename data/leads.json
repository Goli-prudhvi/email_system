      "pain_points": "The technical infrastructure (CTO function) is not providing the unified, real-time data necessary for high-impact performance marketing decisions (CMO function), leading to siloed efforts and poor cross-channel attribution. | Balancing the pressure for aggressive revenue growth (CMO target) with the need for stable, scalable, and personalized technology development (CTO requirement), resulting in trade-offs that slow down critical CRO or technical SEO initiatives. | Facing high Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) because paid media campaigns lack the deep technical integration needed for predictive audience segmentation and advanced personalization across the Hydro Empire digital ecosystem.",
